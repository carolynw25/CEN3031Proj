# Issues Addressed
- The installation of GO and its accompanying libraries, Gorilla Mux and GORM
- The backend portion of the login page
- Implementing the games/exercises of the website
- The installation of Angular and Node.js
- The Dashboard
- The Sign-in page
- The layout of the website

# Successfully Completed Issues
- Created a login portal using golang for backend, administrator account established.
- GO was successfully installed, Gorilla Mux was able to be added to main.go, decided to add again once GORM could be added as well to combine them both with the login page
- Created frontend login page using angular.
- The outline of the dashboard was completed
- The overall layout of the website is almost completed with the tabs/sidebar that we want set up and working.

# Incomplete Issues and Reasoning
- Need to create a registration portal to register multiple accounts. Currently, registration portal code is causing a lot of errors and affecting the local host page.
- Need to incorporate an actual database using Gorilla Mux and GORM to store account info. 
- Was not able to add GORM to main.go, we will use an alternative library such as MongoDB or something else if this issue persists. Currently we only have login info for an administrator, need to use Gorilla Mux and GORM/MongoDB for login/registration through a database
- Need to merge angular frontend page witht the backend login code, running into installation issues.
