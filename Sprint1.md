# Incomplete Issues and Reasoning
- Need to create a registration portal to register multiple accounts. Currently, registration portal code is causing a lot of errors and affecting the local host page.
- Need to incorporate an actual database using Gorilla Mux and GORM to store account info. If GORM is not possible, we will use an alternative library such as MongoDB or something else. Currently we only have login info for an administrator.
- Need to merge angular frontend page witht the backend login code, running into installation issues.
