# Successfully Completed Issues
- Created a login portal using golang for backend, administrator account established.
- GO was successfully installed, Gorilla Mux was able to be added to main.go, decided to add again once GORM could be added as well to combine them both with the login page
- Created frontend login page using angular.

# Incomplete Issues and Reasoning
- Need to create a registration portal to register multiple accounts. Currently, registration portal code is causing a lot of errors and affecting the local host page.
- Need to incorporate an actual database using Gorilla Mux and GORM to store account info. 
- Was not able to add GORM to main.go, we will use an alternative library such as MongoDB or something else if this issue persists. Currently we only have login info for an administrator, need to use Gorilla Mux and GORM/MongoDB for login/registration through a database
- Need to merge angular frontend page witht the backend login code, running into installation issues.
